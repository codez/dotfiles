= Pascal Zumkehr Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

Thankfully copied from http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/codez/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


If there are some shell configuration settings which you want secure or 
specific to one system, place it into a ~/.localrc file. This will be 
loaded automatically if it exists.
